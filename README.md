# Crop-Yield-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-with-Meteorological-and-Pesticide-Data
This project focuses on improving crop yield forecasting by integrating meteorological data and pesticide usage statistics with machine learning models. The dataset includes crop types, area, yield values, and region-wise agricultural data. Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost were implemented and evaluated using MSE, MAE, and RÂ² metrics.
